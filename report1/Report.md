# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
## Requirements
For each of the commands `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`, and using the workspace you created in this lab:
+ Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
+ Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
+ Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument. \

For each, include:
+ A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
+ What the working directory was when the command was run
+ A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
+ Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.

## Results
### For commands with no arguments
My initial working directory is `/home/lecture1` \
When I use `cd` commend with no arguments, the working directory changed to the home directory. There is no output by executing this command. \
After executing the above command, my working directory changed to `/home` \
When I use `ls` commend with no arguments, the output displays all the files under `/home` directory. In my case, there is a file in blue, so I know there is a **lecture** directory under my home directory. \
After executing the above command, my working directory is still `/home` \
When I use `cat` commend with no arguments, it started with a new line. There is no output in this case.
